# How to contribute

Im glad, that you're reading this. :tada:

Some important resources:

- Bugs [Github Issues](https://github.com/BudjetGenix/mobile/issues)
- Chat [Discord](does not exist yet)

# Testing

We want you to test the code. So, please write tests for your code, so nothing would break in production :laughing:

# Submitting Changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](<https://github.com/budjetgenix/mobile/pull/new/(master)>) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Please, always write very clear commit messages, so other people can understand the changes better.
And remember to use atomic commits (one feature per commit)

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

And also remember to follow eslint convensions.

Thanks,
Midka
