# BudjetGenix-Mobile

What is BudjetGenix?

BudjetGenix is an open source budgeting app. It started as project that Midka started and never continued it. 
Now i wanted to start it over and actually make it complete. 
The idea is that you can add expenses and incomes, then the app calculates how much have you used of your budget and where does your money go.
